# Reading & Understanding the Data

* Make sure the dataset is located in your current working directory

```{r}

setwd(choose.dir())

housing_data <- read.csv("housing_data.csv")


```

* Use the str() function to get a feel for the dataset.

```{r}

str(housing_data)

```

* The dataset has 506 rows and 14 columns.

* The column/variable names' explanation is given below:

1) __CRIM :__ Per capita Crime rate by town

* Take a look at the data using the "head()" and "tail()" functions

```{r}

head(housing_data)

tail(housing_data)

```


# Ask and Explore interesting Questions

1) __How does the proportion of African-Americans by town relate to the Median Value of owner-occupied homes?__

2) __How does the nitric oxides concentration in ppm in the air relate to the Median Value of owner-occupied homes?__

3) ????

4) ????

* So, let's get ready to predict the prices of houses!!

# Data Pre-Processing - I

## Missing Values imputation

* Find out the number of missing values in the dataset

* Impute the missing values using the "centralImputation()" function from the DMwR package

```{r}

sum(is.na(housing_data))

library(DMwR)

housing_data <- centralImputation(housing_data)

sum(is.na(housing_data))


```

# Exploratory Analysis

## Summary Statistics

* Understand the distribution of various variables in the datset using the "summary()" function

```{r}

summary(housing_data)

```

## Scatter Plots

* A few bi-variate relationships are plotted below, but you are encouraged to explore the dataset in more detail

```{r fig.height= 8, fig.width = 9}

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(housing_data$MV, housing_data$LSTAT, xlab = "Median House Price", ylab = "Percentage of people in the lower economic strata", main = "Housing Price vs Status")

plot(housing_data$MV, housing_data$CRIM, xlab = "Median House Price", ylab = "Per capita crime by town", main = "Housing Price vs Per Capita Crime")

plot(housing_data$MV, housing_data$NOX, xlab = "Median House Price", ylab = "Nitric Oxide Concentration in ppm", main = "Housing Price vs NOX concentration in ppm")

plot(housing_data$MV, housing_data$INDUS, xlab = "Median House Price", ylab = "Proportion of non-retail business acres per town", main = "Housing Price vs Non-retail business area")

```



## Correlation Plot

* Let's have a look at the various correlations between the variables in the dataset

```{r fig.height= 8, fig.width = 9}

library(corrplot)

corrplot(cor(housing_data), method = "number")

```


# Data Pre-processing - II

* Today we will standardize the data __after__ splitting the data into train and test sets

## Train/Test Split

* 70/30 - Train/Test split

```{r}

set.seed(29)

# the "sample()" function helps us to randomly sample 70% of the row indices of the dataset

train_rows <- sample(x = 1:nrow(housing_data), size = 0.7*nrow(housing_data))

# We use the above indices to subset the train and test sets from the data

train_data <- housing_data[train_rows, ]

test_data <- housing_data[-train_rows, ]

```


## Standardizing the Data

* We will use the Caret pakcage to standardize the data after the split using the __"preProcess()"__ function

* It saves the metrics such as mean and standard deviation used for calculating the standardized value by creating a model object

* We can then use the model object in the __"predict()"__ function to standardize any other unseen dataset with the same distribuiton and variables

```{r}

library(caret)

# The "preProcess()" function creates a model object required for standardizing unseen data

# Do not standardize the target variable

std_model <- preProcess(train_data[, !names(train_data) %in% c("MV")], method = c("center", "scale"))

# The predict() function is used to standardize any other unseen data

train_data[, !names(train_data) %in% c("MV")] <- predict(object = std_model, newdata = train_data[, !names(train_data) %in% c("MV")])

test_data[, !names(train_data) %in% c("MV")] <- predict(object = std_model, newdata = test_data[, !names(train_data) %in% c("MV")])

```


# Modelling the Data

## Basic Model

## unnecessary

* The "." adds all the variables other than the response variable while building the model.

```{r}

model_basic <- lm(formula = MV~. , data = train_data)

summary(model_basic)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(model_basic)


```

## stepAIC model

* "stepAIC()" is a function in the MASS package

* stepAIC uses AIC (Akaike information criterion) to either drop variables ("backward" direction) or add variables ("forward" direction) from the model

```{r}

library(MASS)

# Here we use the "backward" direction as model_basic used all the variables to build the regression model

model_aic <- stepAIC(model_basic, direction = "both")

summary(model_aic)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(model_aic)

```

## Modifying the Model with the VIF

**Variance Inflation Factor :**

$$VIF_{k} = \dfrac{1}{1 - R_{k}^2}$$

$R_{k}^2$ is the R^2-value obtained by regressing the kth predictor on the remaining predictors. VIF gives us an idea of multi-collinearity

* Every explanatory variable would have a VIF score

* A VIF > 4 means that there are signs of multi-collinearity and anything greater than 10 means that an explanatory variable should be dropped

* We use the "vif()" function from the car package. 

```{r}

library(car)

vif(model_basic)

vif(model_aic)

```

* After applying the stepAIC, the VIF values have slightly reduced, but the variables "RAD" and "TAX" have VIF values higher than 4

* Let's take a look at the correlation between the "RAD" and "TAX" variables

```{r}

cor(housing_data$RAD, housing_data$TAX)

```

* The correlation coefficient is extremely high between the "RAD" and "TAX" variables

* let's now remove the "TAX" variable, as it is the lesser significant of the two

* Build another model without the "TAX" variable, and take a look at the VIFs


```{r}

model3 <- lm(formula = MV ~ CRIM + ZN + CHAS + NOX + RM + DIS + RAD + PT + B + LSTAT, data = train_data)

summary(model3)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(model3)

vif(model3)

```


# Evaluation and Selection of Model

## Picking the Right Model

* The third model built after verifying the vif scores has a similar adjusted R^2 score compared to the previous models with significantly lower no. of explanatory variables and inter-variable interactions.

* The VIF values of the predictors in the third model are lower when compared to the the other two models

* Due to the above two reasons we pick the third model

## Prediction

Predict the Housing prices of the unseen boston housing data, using the chosen model.

```{r}

preds_model <- predict(model3, test_data[, !(names(test_data) %in% c("MV"))])

```

## Performance Metrics

Once we choose the model we have to report performance metrics on the test data. We are going to report three error metrics for regression.

### Error Metrics for Regression

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Create a function called mae that measures the mean absolute error, given the actual and predicted points.

$$MAE = \dfrac{1}{n}\times|\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}}|$$

```{r}


mae <- function(actual, predicted){
  
  error <- actual - predicted
  
  mean(abs(error))
  
}

```

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Create a function called mse that measures the mean squared error, given the actual and predicted points.

$$MSE = \dfrac{1}{n}\times(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}})^2$$

```{r}

mse <- function(actual, predicted){
  
  error <- actual - predicted
  
  mean(error^2)
  
}

```

* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Create a function called rmse that measures the root mean squared error, given the actual and predicted points.

$$RMSE = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n}\times(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}})^2}$$

```{r}

rmse <- function(actual, predicted){
  
  error <- actual - predicted
  
  sqrt(mean(error^2))
  
}

```


* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

Create a function called mae that measures the mean absolute error, given the actual and predicted points.

$$MAPE = \dfrac{100}{n}\times\mid\dfrac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}}}{y_{i}}\mid$$

```{r}


mape <- function(actual, predicted){
  
  error <- actual - predicted
  
  mean(abs(error/actual))*100
  
}

```


### Report Performance Metrics

* Report performance metrics obtained by using the chosen model on the test data

```{r}

mae(test_data$MV, preds_model)

mse(test_data$MV, preds_model)

rmse(test_data$MV, preds_model)

mape(test_data$MV, preds_model)

# OR

library(DMwR)

regr.eval(test_data$MV, preds_model)

```
